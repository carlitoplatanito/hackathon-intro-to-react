So what exactly are we covering today?

Well, first I’ll give a quick overview of what React is and why you might want to use it. 

Then, I’ll jump into the very basics of getting started with React. We’ll go through an example of a simple React application as well.

And lastly, I’ll show you how we're using React in our project at iCIMS.

Plain and simple… React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces.

It was created about 5 years ago by Facebook. It is still maintained by Facebook and the open source community on Github.

The most distinguishing idea behind React is that it encourages the creation of reusable UI components.

The idea is that you use React to design simple views for each state in your application and React will update and render the components every time your data changes. 

Each component has its own logic and controls how it renders. You can start with small components, which you can then use to build bigger, more complex components. React components easily allow for code re-use and help maintain a consistent look and feel in your application.

For example, lets look at Youtube, how many components do you see there?

---
If you do a quick breakdown you will notice there are Button components they all look the same featuring an icon with some having additional text.

Focusing on the ListGroup you will notice a bit more of a complex ListItem component which is reused multiple times within the ListGroup, etc.

Now that you’ve learned the basic concept around React, let’s look at some of benefits that come along with using it.
